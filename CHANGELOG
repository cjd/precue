Changes 0.1 -> 0.2 (30/01/2002):
--------------------------------

will get around to implementing calculation soon but for momement that timestamp is fine as it isn't used by LDSF or LDS at all.
*Implemented playlist changing
*Implemented add to playlist on available songs page
*Implemented advanced songs search
*Identified problem with pages playing in reverse order...(no ORDER BY pagenum in mysql query)
